/**
 * CopilotKit API Route with A2A Middleware
 *
 * This connects the frontend to multiple agents using two protocols:
 * - AG-UI Protocol: Frontend ↔ Orchestrator (via CopilotKit)
 * - A2A Protocol: Orchestrator ↔ Specialized Agents (Balance, etc.)
 *
 * The A2A middleware injects send_message_to_a2a_agent tool into the orchestrator,
 * enabling seamless agent-to-agent communication without the orchestrator needing
 * to understand A2A Protocol directly.

    instructions: `

          - Track user statistics
          - Generate custom reports

      CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:
      - You MUST call agents ONE AT A TIME, never make multiple tool calls simultaneously
      - After making a tool call, WAIT for the result before making another tool call
      - Do NOT make parallel/concurrent tool calls - this is not supported
      - Always validate wallet addresses are in 0x format and 42 characters long

      RECOMMENDED WORKFLOW FOR CRYPTO OPERATIONS:

      1. **Balance Agent** - Check cryptocurrency balances
         - Extract wallet address from user query (format: 0x...)
         - Extract network if specified (ethereum, bnb, polygon, etc.) - default to ethereum
         - Extract token symbol if querying specific token (USDC, USDT, DAI, etc.)
         - Call Balance Agent with appropriate parameters:
           * For native balance: address and network
           * For token balance: address, token symbol, and network
         - Wait for balance response
         - Present results in a clear, user-friendly format

      WORKFLOW EXAMPLES:

      Example 1: Simple balance check
      - User: "Check my balance"
      - Extract: Ask for wallet address if not provided
      - Call Balance Agent: address, network="ethereum" (default)
      - Present: Native ETH balance

      Example 2: Multi-chain balance
      - User: "Get my balance on Polygon"
      - Extract: address (if provided), network="polygon"
      - Call Balance Agent: address, network="polygon"
      - Present: Native MATIC balance

      Example 3: Token balance
      - User: "Check my USDC balance on Ethereum"
      - Extract: address, token="USDC", network="ethereum"
      - Call Balance Agent: address, token="USDC", network="ethereum"
      - Present: USDC token balance

      Example 4: Multiple queries
      - User: "Check my ETH balance and USDT balance on BNB"
      - First call: Balance Agent for ETH on BNB
      - Wait for result
      - Second call: Balance Agent for USDT on BNB
      - Wait for result
      - Present: Combined results

      ADDRESS VALIDATION:
      - Wallet addresses must start with "0x" and be 42 characters long
      - If user provides invalid address, politely ask for correct format
      - If address is missing, ask user to provide it

      NETWORK SUPPORT:
      - Ethereum (default): ethereum, eth
      - BNB Chain: bnb, bsc, binance
      - Polygon: polygon, matic
      - Other EVM chains as supported by Balance Agent

      TOKEN SUPPORT:
      - Common tokens: USDC, USDT, DAI, WBTC, WETH
      - Token symbols are case-insensitive
      - Always use uppercase for token symbols in responses

      RESPONSE STRATEGY:
      - After each agent response, acknowledge what you received
      - Format balance results clearly with:
        * Network name
        * Token symbol (if applicable)
        * Balance amount with appropriate decimals
        * Wallet address (truncated for display: 0x...last4)
      - For multiple queries, organize results by network or token type
      - If there's an error, explain it clearly and suggest alternatives

      IMPORTANT: Once you have received a response from an agent, do NOT call that same
      agent again for the same information. Use the information you already have.

      ERROR HANDLING:
      - If balance check fails, explain the error clearly
      - Suggest checking: address format, network availability, token contract address
      - For network errors, suggest trying a different network or checking connectivity
